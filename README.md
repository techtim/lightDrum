# lightDrum

App for making MIDI controlled light stage instrument from RaspberryPI 3 and USB-MIDI cable from Alesis, M-audio, etc. just check if they compatible with RPI.

__App works on Mac OS and Raspbian__

Main thing about it is that user can map lights, configure colors, animation triggers and style and send config from Desktop to Raspberry Pi when finished.

Based on [ledMapper](https://github.com/techtim/ledMapper), to have simple all-in-one solution, kind of MIDI addon for content generation.
